# Weather Map API
Get up to date weather in your area. Simply enter your city and see what the weather is like right now! This console application utilizes a Web API to call and parse a JSON file containing weather for your chosen city. This information, which includes the temperature, pressure, humidity, wind-speed, and a description such as "snow," is then presented to you in a readable format.
